## I am a millennial magician; I work to transform complicated, unclear ideas into user-friendly images that are understood by your companyâ€™s consumer. I believe in telling a relatable story through graphics that easily meet the mindset of the consumer. I have studied the basics of traditional advertising before creating my own advertising outline that I have utilized to create unforgettable work for several account campaigns completed during my undergraduate work, as well as in real world execution during various internships.
(See Resume) 
## My portfolio showcases a lineup of some of my most recent and relevant work. I am always ready and willing to tackle new design opportunities and have plenty of room up my sleeve for a few award- winning performances. I am a lover of experiences. I am a believer that life is all about unforgettable experiences that create memories. I am in search of a group in which holding a high regard for creating unforgettable experiences through advertising is a common goal.
