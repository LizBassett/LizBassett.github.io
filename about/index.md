## I am a Millennial Magician; I work to transform complicated, unclear ideas into user-friendly images and concrete strategies that leave a lasting impression in the mind of your companyâ€™s consumer. I believe in telling a relatable story through graphics, and consistent marketing messages that please the mindset of the consumer while simultaneously showcasing all factors seen as necessary by the client.I have studied the basics of traditional advertising before creating my own advertising outline that I have utilized to create unforgettable work for several account campaigns completed during my undergraduate work, as well as in real world execution during various internships. My portfolio showcases a lineup of some of my most recent and relevant work. I am always ready and willing to tackle new design opportunities and have plenty of room up my sleeve for a few award- winning performances. I am a lover of experiences. I am a believer that life is all about remarkable experiences that create memories, and lasting impressions. I am in search of a group in which holding a high regard for creating remarkable experiences through advertising is a common goal.
